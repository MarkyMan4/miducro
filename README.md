# Gameplay

- wave starts
- bugs spawn - can be multiple rounds of spawn per wave
- shoot all the bugs
- powerups may drop as you shoot bugs
    - powerups last until the end of the round
    - instant kill all
    - temporary invncibility
- choose an upgrade
    - menu that randomly displays the choices:
        - increase fire rate
        - increase damage
        - increase move speed
        - random stat reshuffle
        - x% chance to increase some stat and decrease another
        - shotgun - shoots a spread but decreases fire rate significantly
        - splash damage

Other ideas
- to make it harder over time, bugs could lay down "traps" that hurt the player when touched
- increase bug speed over time - so player has to balance increasing their own movement speed 
  to outrun bugs with increasing damage
- when the player takes damage, ~2 second of being invulnerable before taking damange again
- some bugs could shoot projectiles
